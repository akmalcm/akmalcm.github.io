I started playing around with Elasticsearch when I was assigned to add new field to search index. At that time, I've no idea what is Elasticsearch and how it works. There is no documentation about it, so I have to ask around and read the code to understand how it works.

I find it interesting and decided to learn more about it (I don't have choice, I'm in consumer team and I have to maintain it). I started to read the documentation, watch some youtube videos and read some articles. I also started to play around with it, create index, insert data, search data, etc.

Now, I'm the one who maintain the Elasticsearch in my team. I'm not an expert, but I know how to use it and how to maintain it. I'm still learning and I'm still curious about it.
I even created a cheatsheet, and my own custom analyzer to improve the search query.
