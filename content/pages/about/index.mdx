I'm <Age /> years old and I'm a software engineer at [Fave](https://myfave.com).

I start playing with computers since I was 10 years old, "hacking" games using cheat engines and scripts. What a script kiddie.

I started programming during my diploma in computer science, where I learned C++, Java, and PHP. I also learned about web development and started building websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

And during my degree in computer science, I learned about software engineering, algorithms, and data structures. I also learned about mobile development and started building Android apps using Java. I also learned about machine learning and started building machine learning models using Python.

After I graduated, I started working as a software engineer at [Fave](https://myfave.com) as a backend engineer. I learned about API development and started building APIs using Ruby on Rails. I also tinkering around DevOps to optimize the CI/CD flow.
